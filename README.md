# Combined Problem Statement for Hotel Reviews Dataset

The dataset contains two columns:
- **review:** Textual reviews from hotel customers.
- **rating:** Numerical ratings from 1 to 5.

## Objective
Develop a comprehensive machine learning model that leverages hotel reviews to achieve the following outcomes:

1. **Sentiment Classification:** Classify reviews as Positive, Negative, or Neutral based on the text and rating.
2. **Rating Prediction:** Predict the star rating (1 to 5) directly from the review text.
3. **Emotion Detection:** Identify underlying emotions (e.g., Joy, Anger, Sadness) expressed in the reviews.
4. **Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA):** Analyze sentiment on specific aspects such as cleanliness, service, and amenities.
5. **Text Summarization:** Generate concise summaries of long reviews for quick insights.

## Methodology
- **Data Preprocessing:**
  - Text cleaning (remove punctuation, lowercase, stopwords removal).
  - Tokenization and embedding using models like Word2Vec or BERT.
  - Handle class imbalance if present.

- **Modeling Approach:**
  - Multi-task learning or modular pipelines where one model can handle multiple subtasks.
  - Use deep learning models (BERT, LSTM) for text-based tasks.
  - Implement transfer learning for better feature extraction.

- **Evaluation Metrics:**
  - Classification: Accuracy, F1-score, Precision, Recall.
  - Regression: Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), R-squared.
  - Summarization: ROUGE, BLEU scores.

## Use Case
This combined model provides a holistic understanding of customer feedback, helping hotel management to:
- Improve service quality by identifying sentiment and aspect-level insights.
- Predict and validate customer ratings automatically.
- Quickly assess customer opinions through summaries.
- Prioritize resources based on emotional analysis and rating trends.
